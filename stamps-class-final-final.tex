 \section{Introduction}

 Donald Knuth developed \TeX\ because of the dissatisfaction he felt
 with the commercial typesetting of his books `The Art of Computer
 programming'~\cite{knuth98}. The program grew into a typesetting system, with 
 a great deal of attention and ingenuity devoted to the calculations of the
 placement of letters, words and paragraphs on a page. More people began
 to use \TeX, and, with the advent of \LaTeX, ready-made class files
 became part of the system. These style files tend to show off the
 capabilities of the system, rather than conform to good design, or, as
 Philip Taylor~\cite{taylor98,taylor99} put it `\ldots all of which shriek 
 ``\TeX'' from every page'.

 This package provides a class to typeset philatelic books. There is both a large
 philatelic literature as well as a lage class of books in this field. They are
 a combination of scholarly work with that of catalogues. They are also image intensive
 and images are not always presented the way LaTeX will typeset them.
 
 This package provides both a class as well as means to store all the information
 regarding the items being presented in a database.

% \section{Preliminaries}
    We begin by declaring a number of commands, parameters and control 
    sequences which will be used later on. 
% \begin{macro}{\@createDB}
    The controlsequence creates an empty DB with the provided name.
%    \begin{macrocode}
%	
\newcommand\@createDB[1]{%
  	\expandafter\let\csname#1\endcsname\@empty
	\expandafter\def\csname #1@sets\endcsname{}
	\expandafter\def\csname #1@sets@by@year\endcsname{}
	\expandafter\def\csname #1@stamps\endcsname{}
	\expandafter\def\csname #1@postalhistory\endcsname{}
}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}

% First we develop some general macros for adding tables to a DB
% We must also decide what to hold in the
% DB
% #1 DB name
% #2 Table name
\newcommand\addtabletoDB[2]{%
  \expandafter\def\csname #1db.table.#2\endcsname{}
}

\def\addfieldvalue#1#2#3#4{%

}

%	We use lists extensively to store the fields and indices of the database
% 	start by adding list manipulation macros
% 	add element and define the element macro
% 	This adds an element to list and keep the list sorted
%	These macros have been borrowed from listings. 
% \begin{macro}{\AddElementToList}
% 
%	\begin{macrocode}
\long\def\AddElementToList#1#2#3{%
  \lst@lAddTo{#1}{#2,}
  \lst@BubbleSort{#1}
}
%	\end{macrocode>
%
%	All list are kept sorted. when a new element is added the list is sorted.
%	Although this slows things at first by having the list sorted better overall
%	performance is achieved.


% 	We create a number of databases we are going to use in our examples. 
%	This is for countries that I had images available and are falling within the
%	ambit of my collecting interests. It also creates th




e empty lists that
%	are used for indexing.

%	Items for a particular country can be sorted by categories. It is common in the
%	literature to divide its history - pretty much like any history - in periods. For
%	example the Cyprus history can be divided into the periods
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item{Venetian}
%		\item{Turkish}
%		\item{Queen Victoria}
%		\item{King Edward VII}
%		\item{King George V}
%		\item{King George VII}
%		\item{Queen elizabeth II}
%		\item{republic Issues}
%	\end{enumerate}
%	
%	Countries are categorized by their respective collecting area. For example
%	British Empire, German Colonies, USA and Territories, Europe etc.
%	A country can belong to more than one category.
%
%	We create the countriescategories list.

\StampDescription[0.90]{cyprus}{SG999}{\RaggedRight 
Fifteen 2c Missionary stamps are recorded, including the unique unused stamp and the unique cover. Of the thirteen used copies, five are in museums, leaving eight used off-cover stamps available to collectors (including one on piece). None of the eight available used copies is entirely sound. This example, with its relatively minor repairs, is one of the finer-appearing examples of this rare stamp. It is the only 2c Missionary with the Crossed Bars cancel, which is also known on three 5c and two 13c (Scott 3) Missionaries.

This 2c Missionary is first recorded as having been owned by dealer William P. Brown, who sold it to Count Philippe de la Renotiere von Ferrary in 1872 for \$25. At the fourth Ferrary sale in 1922 the stamp was purchased by Arthur Hind for the equivalent of \$8,750. Hind also acquired the unique British Guiana 1c Magenta stamp at the Ferrary sales. After passing to Admiral Harris and Maurice Burrus, this stamp was acquired by Thurston Twigg-Smith, who sold it privately to Christian Aall, then bought it back when the Aall collection was sold by the Siegel firm in 1998 (Sale 805).

\chapter{Australian Stamps and Postal History}
%\raggedright

The six self-governing Australian colonies that formed the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901 operated their own postal service and issued their own stamps – see articles on the systems on New South Wales (first stamps issued 1850), Victoria (1850), Tasmania (1853), Western Australia (1854), South Australia (1855) and Queensland (1860). Under section 51(v) of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 1900, “postal, telegraphic, telephonic, and other like services” became a Commonwealth responsibility.
The Commonwealth's Postmaster-General's Department became effective on 1 March 1901 (this agency would be disaggregated on 1 July 1975 in part into the Australian Postal Commission trading as Australia Post). All then-current colony stamps which continued on sale became de-facto Commonwealth stamps. Some of these stamps continued to be used for some time following the introduction in 1913 of the Commonwealth's uniform postage stamp series. These stamps continued to be valid for postage until 14 February 1966 when the introduction of decimal currency made all stamps bearing the earlier currency invalid for use.

Circumstances precluded the immediate issue of a uniform postage stamp series for the new Commonwealth. But there was no hindrance in respect to a Postage Due series. The first of these, the design of which was based on the current New South Wales postage due stamps, was issued in July 1902.

Postal rates became uniform between the new States on 1 May 1911 because of the extension of the United Kingdom domestic postal rate of 1d per half ounce (Imperial Penny Post) to Australia as a member of the British Empire. One penny became the uniform domestic postage rate. One penny postcards and lettercards also appeared in 1911. In the same year, the Postmaster-General's Department held a Stamp Design Competition for a uniform series of Commonwealth postage stamps. This competition attracted over one thousand entries.

{1840 large-part entire headed ``Bay of Islands 21st Feby 1840" to ``George Clendon/Deal/Kent'' with two strikes of the stepped \postmark{EASTBOURNE/SHIP LETTER} h/s \& London b/s of \postmark{18JY18/1840} in red, rated "8" in black for an incoming shipletter, internal splitting and reinforcing. Carried per barque \ship{Westminster} which departed the Bay of Islands 17/3/1840, making a remarkably swift passage of less than 4 months, in an era when voyages of 12 months were commonplace. 

Very few letters from the interim or transitional period between the formal annexation of New Zealand by New South Wales in February 1840 and the opening of the first post office, at \NZindex{Kororarika}, in March 1840 have been recorded. 

The sender was \people{James Clendon}, one of the most prominent early settlers. He settled in the Kororarika (Russell) district in 1832 and in 1838 was appointed United States Consul in New Zealand. 

In 1840 he signed the Treaty of Waitangi as witness to the signatures of several Maori chiefs, and was appointed to New Zealand's first Legislative Council. His property at Okiato was acquired by the new government, but the purchase was only partly-completed and Clendon was compensated with 10,000 acres south of Auckland!! 

This letter was written only two weeks after the original signing on 6th February of the Treaty of Waitangi. In it, Clendon states
\quote
...Our adopted land is now a British Colony. Captain Hobson Lieutenant Governor and Staff arrived on the 29th Jany...It has of course raised the value of land and I hope to turn some of mine to good account. I am probably the largest landholder...Almost every fortnight brings an arrival from Sydney with from 50 to 70 Passengers so that our Bay is getting very thickly populated...I consider my land in the Bay of Islands worth at least \pounds10,000 and a tract between this and the Thames...I would not take less than \pounds20,000...

Ex Michael Burberry (1986), Gerald Ellott \& John Woolfe (Lot 283; acquired for £4465). A remarkable and highly important cover. 

[This was the original of the letter, the duplicate of which is the next lot!]ÞÞNumber 39 in Robin Gwynn's 2005 census of 67 covers and dated pieces from the first year of use of New Zealand stamps. This cover was carried on the only Chalons Period mail-carrying voyage via South America. 

It is illustrated in the Handbook Vol VII at page 62. Only one other such cover is recorded. ÞÞIt is possible that this cover, instead of travelling north to Panama along the west coast of South America, was actually carried overland to Buenos Aires. Howat at page 131 of "South American Packets 1808-1880" states that the \ship{Avon} departed Buenos Aires 3/4/1856 \& Rio de Janeiro 15/4/1856, arriving at Southampton 16/5/1856, the day before the London arrival cds. While this is not conclusive evidence, it is highly relevant that Kenton \& Parsons "Early Routings of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company 1842-1879" list no arriving steamer from Panama that fits comfortably with the 17/5/1856 receival on this cover. As they say in the classics: "The thick plottens!"ÞÞHistorical note: on 27/2/2010, the Chilean port of Talcahauno was largely destroyed by a massive earthquake and tsunami.}%descrition

This was a very common commercial practice in an age when shipwrecks were all too frequent. However, it is most unusual for both such items to be found together. Indeed, with the previous item having been discovered only in the 1980s, our vendor is confident that he is the first person to own both of them. While it may seem odd that the original should have been sent via an exotic and unproven route, it must be remembered that during the Crimean War mails from Australia, and even moreso from New Zealand, were seriously affected by a lack of available ships. The sender doubtless chose to avail himself of the "first ship" opportunity, regardless of the fact that it was sailng eastwards, across the Pacific.}%descrition

An important cover, being carried on the first homeward voyage by the monthly packet mail, per the E\&ARM Co steamer \index{Oneida} that departed Sydney 23/1/1857 carrying a small quantity of New Zealand mail dated the previous month. The five months transit time was due to the \textit{Oneida} breaking down 400 miles off the Western Australian coast and returning to Sydney!!

This is an intriguing cover. Gerald Ellott (2009) at pp217-8 cites research by Mark Benvie as proving the existence of a previously unrecorded 8d rate that came about as the result of an erroneous notice in "The Timaru Herald" of 22/5/1873. The error was corrected in the same newspaper only two days later, making this perhaps the shortest-lived "rate" in all of New Zealand postal history! Copies of the newspaper notices of 2/5/1873 \& 27/5/1873 are included. This is believed to be the only recorded cover at this phantom "rate".

Note: In 1873 the usual via San Francisco route was interrupted and the rate to Switzerland via Suez was officially 9 pence, as introduced in November 1871. The British share on this cover is noted clearly as 2 pence, so it has to be assumed that the reduction in rate to 8 pence (officially pronounced on Jan 1, 1874) was already in force.

However, the absence of any British markings \& the French mailboat cds show that it was sent directly to France] 

From a traditional stamp perspective, this is a very important cover. It is stated to be the earliest recorded non-bisected usage of the 1/- SG 3 on cover, the third earliest cover with SG 3 (the two earlier both bearing bisects), the only recorded usage of SG 3 with another denomination, and the only SG 3 cover to a destination other than Great Britain.

The cover is addressed to "Francois MW Redwood". Francis William Redwood emigrated from the UK with his family, arriving at Nelson in 1842. The local Catholic priest encouraged him into the priesthood \& he pursued his studies in France \& Ireland. At this date he was training at St Mary's College at St Chamond, to where the cover is addressed. In January 1874 Redwood was appointed Bishop of Wellington. At 35, he was the youngest Catholic bishop in the world; on his death at 95, he was the oldest! 

The sender was almost certainly Father Antoine Garin\index{Garin Antoine, Father}, Redwood's boyhood mentor in Nelson. AUD\$ 1,500.00R}%4

Akaroa was the site of a French settlement. In 1838, Captain Jean Francois L'Anglois purported to purchase much of the Banks Peninsula, north of Christchurch, from local Maori. On 18/8/1840, 63 French immigrants arrived at what they called Port Louis-Philippe. Despite the fact that the British had by then taken sovereignty over the whole of New Zealand pursuant to the Treaty of Waitangi, and had hoisted the Union Jack at Akaroa, the settlers remained.

A number of covers have been recovered from the wreck of the Colombo, which was sailing off Minicoy islands in 1862.

The ship sunk in heavy storms outside Minicoy islands in the Indian Ocean. A gravure in the Illustrated London News shows the drama some months after it occurred.

\chapter{Mark Benvie Collection}
\normalsize

New Zealand Mail to Overseas Destinations

The International Large Gold Medal (London 2010)
exhibit formed by Mark Benvie of Auckland

In these days of global tourism and jet airliners, New Zealand is a distant but still accessible destination: in the middle of the 19th century, it was the remotest British Colony on the planet.Posting a letter from New Zealand was much easier said than done.  In the earliest days, mail was placed aboard whatever ship was next leaving harbour.  Letters from “home” arrived infrequently, bringing news that was often a year old when it was received.
The tiny white (almost entirely British) population became accustomed to being an afterthought in the minds of politicians and bureaucrats in London.  There was steady improvement in the postal services between England and the more populous Australian Colonies but New Zealanders could avail themselves of the newer and faster ships only by sending mail to Sydney or Melbourne for on-forwarding to the “Old Country”.

Regular contracted monthly packet services between England and Australia were established only in 1856.  (Even then they were not without their dramas, notably breakdowns and shipwrecks.)  It was only from January 1876 that New Zealand’s overseas mail services could be considered both reliable and enduring.

During the intervening period of just two decades, about a dozen different companies strove valiantly to make a success of providing mail services between Australasia and the rest of the world.  Most of them succumbed to the financial pressures of too little freight and too few paying passengers.  Mail subsidies helped but neither their availability nor their continuance could be relied upon.

The Peninsula \& Orient Line (P\&O) was the most successful of the contractors, but all their voyages from Australia to Europe went via Suez.  Faster connections via North America commenced only in 1866 with a via Panama service.  However, three years and three contractors later, this unprofitable route was abandoned.  For the next six months, New Zealanders were again forced to send their mail via Suez.  A new trans-Pacific service via Honolulu and San Francisco then by rail across America commenced in March 1870 but was interrupted several times over the next five years until more reliable ``permanent'' arrangements were finally made.

Almost by coincidence, the years 1856-75, during which so many developments and dramas occurred on the shipping side of things, roughly mirrored the period during which New Zealand’s classic ``Fullface Queens'' or Chalons were on issue.

First released in 1855, this iconic series appeared on various papers; without or with various watermarks; imperforate, perforated or rouletted.  Stanley Gibbons have assigned 139 whole numbers to the Chalon issue\index{Chalon issue}.

Many prominent philatelists have avidly collected New Zealand’s Chalons.  Famous collections of these enchanting stamps were formed by such luminaries as Alfred Caspary, Maurice Burrus and Alfred Lichtenstein.  In more recent times, the Sir Gawaine Baillie and Joseph Hackmey collections have been added to this pantheon.

However, all of these notable collectors were essentially stamp enthusiasts.  Most of them added covers to their holdings but the emphasis was on usage of the stamps rather than the postal history content.

Mark Benvie, a dedicated postal historian, follows in the footsteps of the eminent New Zealander Gerald Ellott MNZM RDP, whom he acknowledges as both mentor and friend.  It was Ellott who, in the 1980s, produced a monumental three-volumes work on the subject of New Zealand’s postal rates and regulations.  It is Mark Benvie who has built on Ellott’s endeavours, filling in gaps in the recorded knowledge, resolving ambiguities and making a number of important discoveries.

As a postal historian, Mark’s interests have been principally in the routes, rates and markings of the mid-1800s.  The stamps of the period are to him incidental, but included here are many fine and attractive frankings and a number of adhesives rarely seen on cover.

Recognising the importance of provenance, most of Mark’s covers have been sourced from the collections formed by Maurice Burrus, Hugh Gordon Kaye, Marcel Stanley, Royce Bowen (“Yeroc”), John Bishop, Gerald Ellott, Joseph Hackmey, the anonymous “Antipodes”, and the wonderfully eccentric John Woolfe.

The collection encompasses all the overseas routes of the period including an 1856 cover sent via Chile, a swag of scarce via Brindisi items, a scruffy but marvellous cover to Brazil via Panama and London, and the only pre-1875 cover recorded from New Zealand to travel via Trieste See\ref{trieste}.

Unusual rates are revealed, including the first short-lived 9d period to the UK and, most notably, a cover from Timaru posted in the 4-days period when the local newspaper erroneously advised readers of an 8d rate to England.

Mark Benvie was also particularly keen to obtain items to destinations other than Great Britain.  Official Post Office figures reveal that as much as 98\% of all overseas mail from New Zealand was sent to the Australian Colonies (a small proportion) or Britain.  That nearly half the items in this collection are to “other” places speaks of a remarkable achievement.

Included here are covers to Belgium (one recorded), Brazil (the only Chalon cover to anywhere in Latin America), Antigua (one recorded), Ceylon, and the unique cover to New Caledonia carried by a French naval vessel.

Mark Benvie’s efforts to tell the complex story of the evolution of New Zealand’s overseas mails were recognised with a National Gold Medal in New Zealand (2005).  To his delight and surprise, the distinguished jury at London 2010, the world’s most prestigious exhibition, conferred on this collection an International Large Gold Medal.

Since it became known that we would be offering this collection, many clients have expressed surprise that it was coming onto the market.  However, having achieved a Large Gold Medal with a display of only five frames  -  a rare accomplishment indeed  -  Mark considered that, from an exhibiting perspective, he could not take the exhibit further in a way that he would find satisfying.  The rules require that for his next outing he would be required to submit eight frames of material.  To do so would entail a far greater reliance on mail to the UK and would almost inevitably result in significant “padding”.  He simply decided that he didn't want to go down that path.

We at Prestige Philately are proud to present this ``pure'' postal history collection.  We hope that you gain as much enjoyment from studying the catalogue as we have gained from preparing it.


\chapter{SHIPPING DISASTERS}

(From the Times, March l 22.) The opening quarter of the year 1870 will, we fear, be memorable hereafter for a terrible succession of disasters at sea. Of the fate of the City of Boston steamship we would speak with as much uncertainty as we can venture to entertain, for ahe may perhaps still be found afloat ; but the hope is forlorn, and if the apprehensions of the public on both sides of the Atlantic should be, unhappily, realized, the catastrophe will be dreadful indeed. The disappearance of such a vessel, without a single trace of ship, crew, or passengers remaining, would not, it is true, be without precedent, but the precedents are so rare as almost to tell against the supposition. It is nearly thirty years since the President was lost, and since that time only two Atlantic packets have shared a similar fate. 

In 1854 the City of Glasgow, and in 18S6 the Pacific, left port and were never heard of again ; but these, we believe, are the only examples of such losses in the history of Atlantic navigation. In other cases the wreck has been partial, or some have been saved to tell the tale of disaster, and, indeed, the track across the ocean is now so well defined and so incea santly traversed that, except through some overwhelming and instantaneous catastrophe, no vessel could altogether disappear. What may have happened, in the event of the worst, to the City of Boston it would be vain to conjecture. A collision with an iceberg, an overpowering tempest, or a fire on board might be imagined to account for the result ; but the appalling fact would be tjhat a fine, well-found,' and well-msnned steamship had gone to the bottom with every soul on board. Of the wrecks of the Oneida and the Normandy we have more to gay. Of the destructive collision between the Oneida and the Bombay we have received only sufficient information to leave us more perplexed' than before. It seems to be now established that the Bombay did indeed run into the Oneida and cut her down immediately, without slacking her course or stopping to render any assistance to the sinking Teasel. It is alleged, however, on the side of the British vesse), and not disputed so far as we can see by the Americans, that the
collision itself was the fault of the Oneida's pilot. 

The charge against the English commander, is that whereas by timely aid he might probably have saved a hundred lives, he left all these victims to perish without the i slightest heed. His defence is that he neither trie W nor suspected any thing of their, danger. The shock of the collision was so little felt by the Bombay that her captain did not imagine any harm could have been done, and therefore he continued his course. The American version of the occurrence contained statements almost incompatible with such a story. Not only did the Oneida hail the Bombay for assistance, but she blew her whistle as a signal of distress and fired five guns. It is even explained to us how these guns happened to be ready loaded. The Oneida had only left Yokohama two hours before the disaster occurred, and she had expected on going out of port to have to return the salute of a Russian gunboat in the harbour ; but this salute, as it happened, was not given, and so the guns remained loaded. In proof, too, that they were actually fired, it is said the reports vrere heard at Yokohama ; and yet, in contravention of all these assertions, we find, even in the American accounts of the affair, very strange and forcible testimony. When the Bombay arrived at Yokohama, an hour or two afterwards, the proceedings of her Commander, and not only of her Commander, but of her crew and passengers, were entirely consistent with the story afterwards told. Captain Eyre made no report of any collision or accident, nor did he communicate with any of the authorities on the BUbject. Not a word, in short, was known of the affair until fifteen of the survivors landed from the lifeboat the next day, and when they appeared it was as much to the astonishment of the Bombay's crew as to the inhabitants of the place. " 

The passengers," says a New York paper — " the passengers of the Bombay, were quite surprised when they heard the calamity that had befallen the vessel they had struck, but declare they neither heard any request from the Oneida to stay by them or minute guns fired ;" and the report goes on to state that a Naval Court was immediately demanded by the captain of the Bombay, as if in full confidence of his innocence. Of the proceedings and finding of that Court we have already heard something, though not much to our satisfaction. Captain Byre seems to have, been acquitted of blame aa regarded the collision, but his certificate was suspended for six months in consequence of his omission to render assistance to the Oneida's crew. 

By what conclusions the sentence could have been thus measured we are at a loss to understand, but, we presume, the last can hardly have been heard of the affair, and we suspend our judgment. In America the indignation is naturally great, nor can we affect to be surprised at the announcement, made on Saturday by our own correspondent, that " The circumstance that it is an American war- vessel which has been run down, and that the vessel running it down is a British merchant steamer, is an additional cause of bad feeling." That cause of anger, however, will cease, we should hope, on reflection. Even if the nationality of either vessel could alter the complexion of the occurrence, it must be perfectly manifest to the Americans that such nationality could not in the present case have been known or suspected. It is the very essence of Captain Eyre's defence — a defence apparently supported by the unanimous testimony of his passengers — that he hardly knew that he had struck a ship at all, still less that she was an American ship or an American man-of-war. The night was pitch dark, the ships could see nothing of each other but their lights, and though it is lamentable that the British Commander should cot have stopped to see what had been done, or what it behoved him to dp, it is hard to believe that he could have known the truth. The more recent disaster in the Channel is another terrible example of a collision at sea. 

The Normandy was one of the London and South-Western Company's fleet of steamers plying between Southampton and the Channel Islands. 

She was a fine vessel, of nearly 500 tons burden, very fast, and only six years old; and, like the Oueida, she had only* just left port when the disaster occurred. In this case also the night was dark, with a thick fog, and though we do not know at what speed the Normandy was going, we are expressly told that the Mary, a screw steamer of nearly double her tonnage, was going "dead slow, with little or no headway." Nevertheless, when these vessels came into collision the Normandy shared the fate of the Oneida, and was instantly cut down. The Mary, however, did not escape like the \ship{Bombay}. She suffered so terribly from the shock that her safe arrival in port appears miraculous, and yet she seems to have done what she could" for the assistance of the sinking ship. Her boat did not succeed in saving any lives, but she remained on the spot to pick up the boats of the Normandy, and to give what succour could be given. In other respects the similarity between the two stories is remarkable. The collision, the crash, and in ten minutes mere : the final, catastrophe, are described in almost the same words. The loss of life was deplorable ; in fact, the full tale of deaths, if the City of Boston: is to be classed with the Normandy and Oneida, would be almost unexampled. Stormy, too, as the season has been, it was not to the tempest that these wrecks have been due. Possibly the City of Boston perished from stress of weather, but the Oneida and the Normandy went down in smooth with water, without a minute's warning of their peril.

{1831 The Posta Europea system was established in 1824 by an expatriate from Livorno, Michele Pietro Meratti. He owned a small publishing house in Alexandria and had the idea of offering the town residents and merchants a local post service. This idea rapidly expanded into the Posta Europea and a postal service for nearly all lower Egypt. For further reference please see Peter Smith "Egypt-Stamps \& Postal History, a Philatelic Treatise" published by James Bendon in 1999. The following lots are from the collection formed by the late lamented Ambassador Luca Daniele Biolato. 1831 (July 11): Entire letter from the Tuscan Consul in Cairo (cachet on reverse) to the Tuscan Consul in Alexandria, endorsed at top "Con Corriere Europeo" in manuscript. This entire is the earliest recorded item sent by the Meratti Posta Europea, mentioned by Smith on page 15 and illustrated (as are many of the following lots) by Biolato.

1864: Essays for the Posta Europea Adhesive Stamps The magnificent album page with the four cut square examples for four values as proposed to the Government by \people{Giacomo Muzzi}; lithographed in black on coloured paper inscribed "POSTA EUROPEA / MANSURA": 10 para in yellow, 20 para in blue, 30 para in green and 1 piastre value in white; together with rectangular framed Essays in black on white paper (Piastre Tarifa) "Piast.e Tar.a 1.", "Piast.e Tara.a 1,20", Piast.e Tar.a 2." and "Piast.e Tar.a 3." It is interesting to note that all the values correspond to the rates of the Posta Europea and those of the later Government Post. These Essays were originally found, as offered, glued to the album page and consequently suffer from small faults of negligible importance due to their rarity: of the coloured Essays only two sets of the four values were recorded prior to this (one ex Dr. W. Byam, one ex King Farouk) and of the value only Essays only one other set has been recorded, again ex King Farouk. See Smith pages 22-23. Nile Post E1-E4 and unlisted. Cert.

%% THIRD PYRAMID ISSUE
\chapter{1879 Pyramid Issue}

Third unified Sphinx and Pyramid design. Usually known as the De La Rues (printed in London). Seven values: 5pa, 10pa, 20pa, 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p. Some stamps experienced changes in colour.

\subsection{De La Rue has Postes Egyptiennes at the top}

In 1879 the design of the definitive postage stamps was changed again to incorporate the words in French 'Postes Egyptiennes' to reflect the take-over of postal operations by the Egyptian posts. Notice the arabic inscription at the bottom. In the next issue this is to be moved to the top. This design was printed much more clearly as it was done in Britain by De La Rue. The selection of De La Rue was not surprising given the poor printing of the previous issues by Penasson.

\section{1926 12th Agricultural Exhibition}
\index{1926!Agricultural Exhibition}
\index{Royal imperforate printings} 
\index{cancelled stamps}
\normalsize
This set of six values was issued in 1926 to celebrate the 12th Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition that took place in Cairo.

In April 1926, the Survey Department, a government agency in Cairo, took over the printing of Egyptian stamps. One sheet of each stamp printed by the Survey Department, not those printed out 
of the country or overprints, was sent to the Royal Collection starting with the 12th Agricultural and 
Industrial Exposition Issue in 1926 up to and including the stamp celebrating the Birth of Crown 
Prince Ahmed Fuad in 1952.   

The Royal Imperforate Printings were printed on stout, unwatermarked, ungummed paper and were not perforated.  On the reverse of each sheet was diagonally printed “cancelled” in English. On later 
issues, starting in 1947, the printing on the reverse was changed to Arabic by King Farouk.

The Royal Imperforate sheets were confiscated with the rest of the Royal Collection, by the Republic of Egypt when King Farouk was deposed.  The Palace Collections of Egypt were auctioned off at the 
Koubbeh Palace, Cairo on February 12 - 15, 1954 by H. R. Harmer of London.


In February, 1954 many of the world’s stamp dealers converged on Cairo.  The military government which had ousted King Farouk two years earlier had retained the London firm of H.R. Harmer to auction off his extensive postage stamp holdings.\sidenote{by PAUL TALBOT \url{http://paultalbot.com/postage-stamp-stories/a-historic-stamp-auction-in-cairo/}}

While the frequently ill-mannered Farouk caroused in Europe, his massive holdings of stamps were put on the block.  The first few days of the auction were not well-attended.  But when European dealers arrived prices were driven up by demand for the material.

Many of the postage stamps sold were seen for the first time.  Unlike the so-called errors that unscrupulous governments often churn out deliberately, these Egyptian errors were authentic.

One of the stamp dealers at this auction was Canada’s Kasimir Bileski from Winnipeg, Manitoba.

The various errors and varieties that turned up, did so legitimately during the printing of the stamps.  They were never put on the market or offered for sale to anyone at fancy prices.  In fact, the last thing anyone expected was that such ever would be available to collectors.  Their very existence was unknown.

Today, many Egypt collectors have stamps from this historic auction, which have been certified as being in King Farouk’s collection.  The King had a particular fondness for rare color overprints.

He also had an obsessive fondness for food\ldots it was not unusual for Farouk to have a dozen eggs for breakfast.  Foul, misogynous and unbalanced, he was not cut out for leadership.

But King Farouk loved his postage stamps, spent a lot of time with his collection, and from 1936-52 ran the Egyptian Post Office as his personal philatelic fiefdom.

A sour note followed the auction.  The military dictators never paid the fees and commissions due to H.R. Harmer.

\index{1942!Al-Azhar University, unissued}

When King Farouk's collection was sold at auction a number of surprises came. One was the unissued Al-Azhar University, stamps. Apparently only 102 of each value were printed and hence are quite rare.

The 1942 unissued Al-Azhar University set is made up of three values; 6m green, 15m dull purple and 20m gray, without the red overprint applied when the set was later released. Only 102 of each value were printed and discovered during the King Farouk auction.

1942 Al-Azhar University (unissued) set of three with oblique perfs, mint nh, very fine and scarce, only 100 sets printed (NP 87b-90b, \$1'000)

Al-Azhar University is an educational institute in Cairo, Egypt. Founded in 970\~972 as a madrasa, it is the chief centre of Arabic literature and Sunni Islamic learning in the world.1 It is the oldest degree-granting university in Egypt after Cairo University. In 1961 non-religious subjects were added to its curriculum.2

It is associated with Al-Azhar Mosque in Islamic Cairo. The university's mission includes the propagation of Islamic religion and culture. To this end, its Islamic scholars (ulamas) render edicts (fatwas) on disputes submitted to them from all over the Sunni Islamic world regarding proper conduct for Muslim individuals and societies. Al-Azhar also trains Egyptian government appointed preachers in proselytization (da'wa).

Its library is considered second in importance in Egypt only to the Egyptian National Library and Archives. In May 2005, Al-Azhar in partnership with a Dubai information technology enterprise, ITEP launched the H.H. Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Project to Preserve Al Azhar Scripts and Publish Them Online (the ``Al-Azhar Online Project'') with the mission of eventually providing online access to the library's entire rare manuscripts collection (comprising about seven million pages).










\chapter{Consular Post Offices}\euro600

\normalsize

The special situation of Egypt as a nominal province of the Ottoman Empire and the special dispensations allowed to European citizens under the Capitulations meant that six foreign nations were allowed to operate national post offices in Egypt via their consulates. These were initially established in Alexandria and Suez, as the main ports at the time, and where most Europeans lived or conducted business. Later further offices were opened in Cairo and Port Said as their importance grew. 

These offices gave nationals of the respective countries the facility to send mail from Egypt to any destination within the foreign country served by its own mail routes. They operated with almost complete autonomy outside the Egyptian postal services and used their own national stamps and their own carriers for the transport of mail to and from Egypt. Incoming mails were delivered to the consulate and had to be collected by the addressee from the premises, while outgoing mail had to be franked with the stamps of the nationality of the shipping line. Mail could be sent from within Egypt to the consular post office by payment of the local Egyptian postage. After the introduction of Egyptian stamps in 1866 this led to some letters bearing stamps of both Egypt and of the country of destination. These fascinating "mixed frankings" are much sought-after and command a good premium. 

The foreign consular offices were established and operated as follows: France 1837-1931; Greece 1833-1881; Austria 1837-1874; Russia 1857-1875; Britain 1839-1878; Italy 1863-1884. In most cases the offices did not far outlast the first Universal Postal Union convention signed on 9 October 1874, which allowed postage to be paid in Egyptian stamps from anywhere within Egypt to within UPU signatory countries. Some foreign offices, however, continued to operate for the next decade, and the French Post Office hung on tenaciously up to April 1931.

\chapter{Airmails}

The Gold Medal collection of Dr. Adel Farid ``Egyptian Airmails'' had a Ballon de Monte cover addressed to Cairo and this is perhaps the earliest item associated with aviation and Egypt. Of course it never travelled by ballon to Alexandia, but nevertheless it is an interesting cover\sidenote{Sold by Corinphila in December 2010.}.

\end{marginfigure}
Air Chief Marshal Sir William Geoffrey Hanson Salmond KCB, KCMG, DSO (19 August 1878[1] - 27 April 1933), commonly known as Sir Geoffrey Salmond, was a senior commander in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I. Remaining in the Royal Air Force after the War, he held senior appointments in the Middle East, Great Britain and India. In 1933 Salmond served as Chief of the Air Staff for several weeks before his death from cancer.

On 18 February 1913 Salmond was awarded Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate no. 421, after which. on 17 April 1913, he joined the reserve of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC),[4] although he continued to serve in the regular army. Following staff work in military aeronautics, he went on to take up the post of Officer Commanding, No. 1 Squadron RFC.[4] In the First World War the squadron operated over the Western Front and Salmond and his squadron took part in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, including the Battle of Hill 60 and the Battle of Aubers Ridge.[4]

In 1916 he was sent to command the 5th Wing, RFC,[4] in Egypt, and in July, 1916, he was promoted to temporary Brigadier-General and given command of the RFC in the Middle East,[4] a post which he held with brief intervals, until the end of 1921. The DSO was conferred on him in the London Gazette of 3 March 1917,[4] "for conspicuous ability and devotion to duty when personally directing the work of the Royal Flying Corps during the action.[2] The striking success attained was largely due to his magnificent personal example." The action referred to was during the operations in Sinai at the end of 1916.[2] In this command he was responsible for providing air cooperation for General Jan Smuts's force in East Africa,[3] for the forces in Salonika and Mesopotamia, for Allenby's conquest of Palestine, and for the RFC in India.[3]

While holding the command of the Middle East, he had laid out an airway from Cairo to South Africa,[2] clearing a chain of aerodromes in Central Africa. His idea was to send a demonstration flight or flights of RAF aircraft across Africa, thus providing the link of which Cecil Rhodes had dreamed in a Cape-to-Cairo railway.[3] Salmond contemplated flights by both landplane and flying-boat. He was not destined to put his idea into execution, though his airway was used by Sir Pierre van Ryneveld and Sir Christopher Brand on their first flight to South Africa.[3]

1931 (April 6): Surcharged 50 m. on 27 m. and 100 m. on 27 m. the mint blocks of ten of each value from base of sheet with corner Control numbers "A29" on each. Very rare in multiples of this size: only 10 sets of the issue could be purchased by any one customer from the four Post Offices where the issue was distributed, thus these are the largest multiples that should exist - also showing varieties spaced '5 and 0' on pos. 47, and dot under arabic date on the 100 m. value (pos. 46). Fresh and fine, large part to unmounted original gum Gi = \pounds{840}. 

Note: Of 22'050 sets printed, 2'950 were destroyed as the surcharges were poor, 1'600 were sent to the UPU in Berne, 2'000 sets were retained by the Govt., 8'000 sets were used on mail, 1'000 sets were cancelled to order. This left approximately 9'450 sets available to the public.(500/2600)
